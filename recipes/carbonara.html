    <h3>Discover how to make superb spaghetti carbonara</h3>

    <p>This cheesy pasta dish is an Italian favourite and with the right technique, you can make it perfect every time.</p>
    <p>In this real spaghetti carbonara we dont use any cream, thats strictly forbidden.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pancetta</li>
        <li>Pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Sea salt and ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50 g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a litte freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente.</li>
        <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
        <li>Leave the cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, sp take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or thongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well and don't throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
        <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the thongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, wich thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
        <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
        <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate.</li>
    </ol>
